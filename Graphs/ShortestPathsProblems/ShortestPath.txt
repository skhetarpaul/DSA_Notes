Points to consider:
    Dijkstra Algorithm- O(V**2)
        ->Can be implemented by set and Priority Queue
        ->Single source shortest pth calculation
        ->Does not work with negative edge weight
        
    Find Shortest Path from  source node in a DAG:
        Note that, no cycle is given here so no need for visited array
        We can further reduce the complexity using the Topological sort because:
            In a DAG, A node can only be reavhed by shortest path if its prereq. nodes are reached thru a shortest path. Hence an order can be maintained considering the dependency of each node on other nodes.
            OR,
            Finding shortest path to a vertex is easy if you already know shortest path of all preceding vertices.
    
    Find Shortest Path from  source node in a Undirected Graph with Unit weights:
        This can simply use application of simple BFS algrithm.
